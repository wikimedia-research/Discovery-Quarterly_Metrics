### Mobile vs Desktop

Since there is no "m.wikipedia.org" and, instead, "wikipedia.org" is a responsive page, we must estimate the per-platform breakdown of pageviews via rules on user agents. We can approximate the rules used in Varnish by looking at the top 100 devices, OSes, and browsers that access mobile versions of Wikipedia.

Since OS and browser breakdowns are available via [Pivot](https://pivot.wikimedia.org), we can just get those from there. For devices, a Hive query is required:

```Hive
SELECT
  user_agent_map['device_family'] AS device_family,
  COUNT(1) AS pageviews
FROM wmf.webrequest
WHERE
  webrequest_source = 'text'
  AND year = ${year} AND month = ${month} AND day = ${day} AND hour = ${hour}
  AND is_pageview
  AND agent_type = 'user'
  AND access_method = 'mobile web'
GROUP BY user_agent_map['device_family']
ORDER BY pageviews DESC
LIMIT 100;
```
